# CSC207-Assignment
A simple text encryption program written in Java, for an assignment in the UofT course CSC207.

The assignment requires this simple program to be designed by entering prompts in [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) to generate the code, and afterwards we can modify the code to correct for errors or refine the overall quality. The prompts entered must be covering a wide range of software design principles, from the technical ones such as SOLID, Clean Architecture, and design patterns, to the more soft-skill things, such as ethical and accessibility concerns of the program.
